# UFC Fighter Stats Website
This is a personal project of mine. The project demo is available at www.erick.codes/ufc
It's a web app that parses through historical fight data from the UFC (from 2010 - 2021). The data is then organized by fighter so that users can search up any fighter and see relevant stats like their record and their average betting odds. The site also analyzes 2 searching algorithms (Exponential Search and Jump Search), and displays the analysis every time the user makes a search.
